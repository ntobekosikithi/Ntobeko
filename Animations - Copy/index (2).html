    <p style="margin-left:10px;font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size:17px;">When your playlist strikes all the right chords, your body can go on a physiological joyride. Your heart rate increases. Your pupils dilate. Your body temperature rises. Blood redirects to your legs. Your cerebellum mission control for body movement becomes more active. Your brain flushes with dopamine and a tingly chill whisks down your back. About 50 percent of people get chills when listening to music. Research shows that's because music stimulates an ancient reward pathway in the brain, encouraging dopamine to flood the striatum a part of the forebrain activated by addiction, reward, and motivation. Music, it seems, may affect our brains the same way that sex, gambling, and potato chips do.</p>

    <p style="margin-left:10px;font-family: arial, sans-serif;font-size:17px;">But music is tricky. It can be unpredictable, teasing our brains and keeping those dopamine triggers guessing. And that's where the chills may come in. Because when you finally hear that long awaited chord, the striatum sighs with dopamine soaked satisfaction and BAM you get the chills. The greater the build up, the greater the chill.
    But there are competing theories. Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, for example, discovered that sad music triggers chills more often than happy music. He argues that a melancholy tune activates an ancient, chill inducing mechanism a distress response our ancestors felt when separated from family. When a ballad makes us feel nostalgic or wistful, that evolutionary design kicks into gear.

What's interesting about Panksepp's theory, though, is that chills don't sadden most people. The experience is overwhelmingly positive. Recent research shows that sad music actually evokes positive emotions sadness experienced through art is more pleasant than the sadness Your experience from a bad day at the office.  
 And this may hint at another theory. The amygdala, which processes your emotions, responds uniquely to music. A somber tune may activate a fear response in the amygdala, making your hair stand on end. When that happens, your brain quickly reviews whether there's any real danger. When it realizes there's nothing to worry about, that fear response becomes positive. The fear subsides but the chill remains.</p><p style="margin-left:10px;font-family: arial, sans-serif;font-size:17px;">The study of music and emotion seeks to understand the psychological relationship between human affect and music. It is a branch of music psychology with numerous areas of study, including the nature of emotional reactions to music, how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt, and which components of a musical composition or performance may elicit certain reactions. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as philosophy, musicology, music theory and aesthetics, as well the acts of musical composition and performance.</p>
